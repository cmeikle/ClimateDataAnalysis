# Climate Data Analysis
This is a repository where I will pull in different data sets to perform data manipulation and analysis on them.

The Netcdf with Xarray directory includes:
1. Plot of data for th 13th August this year of an absorbing aerosol index dataset, found here:https://www.temis.nl/airpollution/absaai/. 
2. A by monthly script. This allows you to query the specific dataset urls, which is much quicker than pulling down each dataset separately or as a large daily data dump.
